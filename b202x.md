B 202x is a new dialect of the
[B programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_(programming_language)).
B was a predecessor to C designed to run on the PDP-7 and
similar word-oriented machines, so it is preadapted to
work well on the PDP-8/X.  Indeed, the transition from B
to C took place because B's word-oriented and typeless nature
wasn't very well suited to the byte-oriented PDP-11.

Here are Brian Kernighan's
[B Tutorial](https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/btut.pdf),
Ken Thompson's [User's Reference to B](https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/kbman.html) for the PDP-11,
and S.C. Johnson's [User's Reference to B in MH-TSS](https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/bref.pdf).
an operating system for the Honeywell
(formerly GE) [H6070](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeywell_6000_series),
a 36-bit computer with an 18-bit address space.
Note that the total length of these documents
is less than 60 pages, and the two Reference manuals
partly duplicate each other.  The ANSI C19 spec is 540 pages.

The following minor changes separate B 2020 from the B described above;
they are made to improve the familiarity of B to C programmers.

 * `//`-style comments.
 * `int`, `int *`, `int **` ... are synonyms for `auto`
 * 32-bit `float` constants (which will not work with integer operators)
 * the `0x` hexadecimal prefix
 * the `continue` statement, which had not yet been invented
 * `inline` declaration keyword
 * `register` declaration keyword (puts things on page zero)
 * structs (details to be worked out)
 * The `do`...`while` loop
 
 More to come.
