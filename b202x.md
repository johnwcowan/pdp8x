B 202x is a new dialect of the [B programming language]().
B was a predecessor to C designed to run on the PDP-7 and
similar word-oriented machines, so it is preadapted to
work well on the PDP-8/X.  Indeed, the transition from B
to C took place because B's word-oriented and typeless nature
wasn't very well suited to the byte-oriented PDP-11.

Here are Brian Kernighan's
[B Tutorial](https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/btut.pdf)
and S.C. Johnson's [B Reference Manual](https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/bref.pdf).
The latter has some specific references to the Honeywell
(formerly GE) [H6070](), a 36-bit computer with an 18-bit address space
Note that they are only 40 pages long together,
whereas the ANSI C19 spec is 540 pages.

The following minor changes separate B 2020 from the B described above;
they are made to improve the familiarity of B to C programmers.

 * `//`-style comments.
 * `int`, `int *`, `int **` ... are synonyms for `auto`
 * 32-bit `float` constants (which will not work with integer operators)
 * `0x` hexadecimal prefix
 * The `continue` statement, which had not yet been invented
 * `inline` declaration keyword
 * `register` declaration keyword (puts things on page zero)
 * structs (details to be worked out)
 
 More to come.
